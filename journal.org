**** summary after reinstall ubuntu16.04 
It is me who get myself in the trouble.I want to change my desktop to gnome in place of unity yesterday.I find it's very uncomfortable to
use gnome,so i decide to uninstall gnome desktop.To be honest,i want to purge all application about gnome.After i finish that,i find i can
start many applications such as uget,chrome.What's more,the icons in the bottom bar also disappeared quietly.All happned scared me,however
i don't how to solve this problem.So i have to reinstall all applications back.Then i reboot,but i can't log in my system anymore.Saddly,i
have to make a hard decision that is to reinstall ubuntu16.

i download from web is for ubuntu14,it's amazing to me that the version is valid in ubuntu16.
